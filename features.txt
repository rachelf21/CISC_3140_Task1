I used the following ImageMagick commands to create the animation:

1. label:  this created the individual text files
2. convert:  flags used included delay, page, loop to convert the above images into an animated gif
3. convert -annotate to add the small text down at the bottom

This was fun! I enjoyed playing around with this!
